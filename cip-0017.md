## Abstract

Expand the definition of what constitutes a valid asset name such that three letter asset names become available to register.

## Specification

1. Update ```generate_asset_name``` and ```generate_asset_id```, the two functions used to validate asset names, such that three letter asset names become valid.
2. Create a special 5 XCP registration fee for LLL asset names.

## Motivation

Most popular cryptoexchange ticker format.

## Rationale 



## Backwards Compatibility

This change will require a hardfork upgrade to the protocol.

## Reference Implementation
