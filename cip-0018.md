## Abstract

Expand the definition of what constitutes a valid asset name such that three letter asset names become available to register.

## Specification

1. Update ```generate_asset_name``` and ```generate_asset_id```, the two functions used to validate asset names, such that three letter asset names become valid.
2. Create a special 10 XCP registration fee for three letter asset names.

## Motivation

The most popular ticker format on crypto-exchanges and stock exchanges are three letters. This would create new interest in the Counterparty platform.

## Rationale 

Many crypto and non-crypto organizations use a three letter ticker symbol that as much a part of their brand as their name.
Currently if such a project or company wished to utilize the Counterparty platform they would be required to change their branded ticker.

In most cases this would cause those organizations to never consider Counterparty. 

The Counterparty platform is indeed in competition with other platforms that also provide for token creation such as Ethereum. 
This is very analogous to the competition between Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange.

It was only in 2007 that Nasdaq was approved by the SEC to allow companies to retain their three-character symbols to help increase competition. 

When the SEC handed down its decision they stated that removing the three-letter symbol rule would "remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate." The SEC further stated that it would reduce confusion among investors of companies that may switch.

Counterparty in a way has been handicapped by imposing the self-inflicted restriction on three letter assets while there is is no technical rationale for such a restriction.

There has been some opposition by some in the community who feel that the new three letter assets would potentially undermine the value of their holdings of some four letter assets. This worry is not lost on the authors of this CIP as both authors are also holders of four letter assets. That concern is easier to set aside by considering the irony that the opposite may be true and we could actually see an increase in the value of all assets. If some high profile projects were to launch on Counterparty it would serve to create much needed excitement in the platform and we could actually an increase in the value of all assets.

While many companies absolutely need their three letter ticker, others identify with four letters and that is not likely to change.

We will have a big opportunity to generate a lot of attention to our platform during the prelaunch time period.

These three letter assets should be treated as the super premium assets that they are. For that reason this CIP proposes that ten (10) XCP be burned in order to create a three letter asset. While this fee may be too low, as some community members have reasoned, it is certainly not too high for high for these premium assets. With 16,900 possible three letter asset names we could see a large amount of XCP burned to acquire these assets which may indirectly benefit XCP holders by tightening the supply.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change will require a hardfork upgrade to the protocol.
